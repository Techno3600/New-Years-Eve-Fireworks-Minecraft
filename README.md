# New-Years-Eve-Fireworks-Minecraft

This plugin is a simple fireworks plugin for the New Years. You can check it out over at https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/new-years-eve-fireworks-plugin.87260/.

You can build this plugin using Maven.

If you would like to contribute, I would like someone to create a way to configure stuff using the config.yml (messages, title message, amount of fireworks, cooldown, etc.). However, I will not be adding this on my own because it is a snapshot of a plugin I use on my own survival server (https://technocraftmc.net) and needs no extra confiuration on my part. 


Things to be aware of:
- This plugin is not configurable
- This plugin requires TitleAPI (included in zip)
- This plugin has only been tested on the latest version
- This plugin sets the time to night ONLY for the individual player (the actual server's time is not set to night)
- All firework damage is disabled while this plugin is active
